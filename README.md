# SharduinoPinController

## Overview
SharduinoPinController establishes a seamless link between C# applications and Arduino hardware, enabling control over Arduino pins through a serial port. This tool is ideal for manipulating LED states and other digital signals directly from a C# interface.

## Features
- **Pin Control**: Easily toggle Arduino pins between HIGH and LOW states.
- **Serial Communication**: Facilitates communication between C# and Arduino via serial port.
- **Arduino Auto-Detection**: Automatically detects the connected Arduino port.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive for all levels of users.
- **Open Source and Customizable**: Perfect for educational, hobbyist, or professional projects.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Arduino board
